Introduction:-

--> An online whiteboard is a great tool for collaboration and remote communication. You can create diagrams,
 flowcharts, drawings, and share notes all in real-time. You can also create presentations and comment on 
 them.
--> I times like covid when childrens are locked in home away form school, we can use this platform to help 
   them visualise and also improve their handwritting. 
-->By using tools such as online whiteboards, you can make remote working more simple for your entire team 
   whether they are in or out of the office

Goal:-
--> With white board , we want students to have the ability to find the answers and present them just as a 
    teacher would. It gives every student a voice regardless of their level.
--> We want White Board to connect  with multiple collaborators who would be able to present their ideas.
